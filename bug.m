In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `retain` and `release` in manual memory management (MRC).  Specifically, it involves scenarios where an object is retained multiple times without a corresponding release, creating a retain cycle. This often manifests subtly, causing memory leaks that are difficult to detect with standard debugging tools.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) MyClass *otherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    MyClass *newObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    self.otherObject = newObject; //retain
    [newObject someOtherMethod]; // retain cycle created if someOtherMethod retains 'self'
    //Missing [newObject release];
}
@end
```

This code snippet shows a potential retain cycle. If `someOtherMethod` in `newObject` retains `self` (the original instance of `MyClass`), a cycle is created. Without proper release, both objects remain in memory indefinitely.
