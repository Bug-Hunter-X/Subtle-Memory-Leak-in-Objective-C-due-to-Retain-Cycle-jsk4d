The solution lies in properly managing object lifetimes using `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  In the corrected code, we ensure that every `retain` call is balanced by a `release` when the object is no longer needed.  Alternatively, using ARC eliminates the need for manual memory management.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyClass *otherObject; //ARC
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    MyClass *newObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    self.otherObject = newObject; //retain (managed by ARC)
    [newObject someOtherMethod];
    //No manual release needed (ARC)
    //In case of MRC [newObject release]; is needed. 
    //Also a release in dealloc should be added for MRC
}
@end
```

**ARC (Automatic Reference Counting):** Modern Objective-C uses ARC, which automatically handles retain and release calls.  Switching to ARC is the best solution to avoid these retain cycle errors.
